This package uses the following libraries:

 * clipper:  The clipper library has been released under the Boostv1 license.

 * dggrid:   Kevin Sahr has released dggrid as a 
             "public domain software program"

 * proj4lib: Gerald Evenden has released this code into the public domain. More
             recent versions of the library, not used here, are under an
             MIT-style license.

 * shapelib: Frank Warmerdam has released shapelib under an MIT-style license.
             There is also an LGPL licensing option which I have chosen not to
             use.

All code and documentation not otherwise mentioned above (essentially anything
outside the `src/` directory of this package) is released under an MIT (Expat)
license, as follows.
